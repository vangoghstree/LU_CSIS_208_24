        <h1>My favorite Bible Verse.</h1>
<p>
    My favorite bible verse is John 13:12-20 (ESV):</p>

    <div>
        12&nbsp;When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? 13&nbsp;You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. 14&nbsp;If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. 15&nbsp;For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. 16&nbsp;Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 17&nbsp;If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. 18&nbsp;I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, ‘He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’ 19&nbsp;I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he. 20&nbsp;Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.”
